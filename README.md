# Superarv_Bot
This is a multipurpose discord bot developed by me. It will have more features as we progress further into devlopment. As for what functionalities I want this to have down the line: I want this to be a 24/7 online bot with many quizzes, ranking systems, daily challenges, randomly generated text, and many other chatbot functionalities. I see this bot as being the life of any small server and a helpful tool in bigger community servers.
